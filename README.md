# Wuwa Abby

Wuwa Abby is a tracking tool designed to help players of Wuthering Waves track and plan their wish (convene) progress. The site allows users to monitor their pity, view their wish history, analyze stats, and manage multiple profiles if they have more than one account.

> ATOW: _I’m the sole developer working on this project, and while I’ve put in a lot of effort to make it useful, progress has been slow due to my limited free time. However, there's another fantastic and frequently maintained tracker that I highly recommend, called [WuWa Tracker](https://wuwatracker.com/). If you're looking for a reliable tool with regular updates, do check them out!_
